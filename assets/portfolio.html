                        <p>
                            My interest in the world of technology started back in 2017 when I was 9 years old. 
                            I was first introduced to programming in the form of chatbots, and I was fascinated by 
                            the idea of creating something that could interact with users. Since then, I have been 
                            exploring various fields in technology, such as <u>web development 🌐</u>, <u>machine learning 🦾</u>, and <u>robotics 🤖</u>.
                            I am currently a student at <u>Bukit Panjang Government High School 🏫</u>, where I am an experienced programmer of the Science Team Robotics Division, and 
                            have participated in various competitions and projects. Asides from robotics, I am an EXCO member of the BP Student Council (BPSC), in which 
                            I enjoy being a part of as I found myself being able to contribute to the betterment of the school. 
                            I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, and I am excited to see where 
                            my journey in technology will take me.

                    <h2 class="portfolio-item">🚀 Experiences</h2>
                    <p>Over the 3 years of being a part of the Science Team Robotics Division, I have gained a lot of experience in programming and robotics and have represented my school in various competitions. Overall, I was able to participate in RoboCup from 2022 to 2024 and in NRC in 2022. The following 2 events highlights my significant achievements: </p>
                    <h4><li>RoboCup Singapore Open 2024 (🥉 3rd place)</li></h4>
                    <p>My team (Impeccable Jawlines) participated in the U19 Rescue Line challenge, where we had to build and program a robot to navigate through a field by following a line and rescue victims in an evacuation zone. This experience was an unforgetable one, as we were able to secure <b>🥉 3rd place</b> in the competition. This was the school's first national podium in Robotics, and we were proud to be the ones who achieved it. 
                    The journey wasen't easy, as we had faced many huge challenges which required us to make difficult decisions. However, we were able to overcome them and achieve our goal. This experience has taught me the importance of teamwork, perseverance, and adaptability, and I am grateful to have been a part of it.</p>

                    <h4><li>RoboCup Asia Pacific 2022 (🏅 1st place for presentations)</li></h4>
                    <p>My team (Dash) participated in the RoboCupJunior Rescue Line Challenge, and we were able to clinch 1st place in presentations. This showed our understanding in what we were doing as we were able to explain the different aspects of our robot, from hardware to software, and how we were able to debug issues we encountered along the way.</p>

                    <p>Think of it as a business card, online! Although simple on the outside, some (cool) features I incooporated into it was the <b>rotating colour profile picture border</b>, <b>social media icons</b> to make contacting me easy, and the <b>hyperlinked buttons</b> that provide shortcuts to my other projects. This project was created using <u>HTML</u>, <u>CSS</u>, and <u>JavaScript</u>.</p>
                    <h3><a href="https://ekqiu.github.io/bpscpersona">BPSC Persona</a></h3>
                    <p>BPSC Persona is a project I created for the BP Student Council (BPSC) to help the student council members get a better understanding of their leadership personality, and be able to find people who are like minded. Using a similar system as MBTI to determine the personality, the user is brought through an adventure where their abilities will be tested. A personality card will then be generated with their name on it, which can be shared through a click of a button. This project was created using <u>HTML</u>, <u>CSS</u>, and <u>JavaScript</u>.</p>
